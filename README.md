<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93063807?s=400&u=e5e149de356d271cd97bddafb8adca1af6f1df70&v=4)](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93063807?s=400&u=e5e149de356d271cd97bddafb8adca1af6f1df70&v=4)

Natum is a cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum Network with a purpose which is to motivate people to focus on work by using the pomodoro method which is proven to be highly effective as the Human Mind can only focus for 25 mins and after that we tend to loose concentration. Thus Natum is meant to help you to stay focused

<!-- LIVE DEMO -->

## Live Demo

Pomodoro App(https://thrinayan-pomodoro.netlify.app/)

Crypto Token()

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the code follow this steps below 

### Prerequisites

Softwares and Websites needed
* Visual Studio Code 
  ```sh
  https://code.visualstudio.com/
  ```
* Remix IDE(Ethereum Compiler and Smart Contracts)
   ```sh
  https://remix.ethereum.org/
  ```

### Installation

1. Install Live Server(HTML,CSS,JS)
   ```sh
   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
   ```
2. Installl Solidity Packages
   ```sh
   https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Pomodoro app can be used as a focus app and can also have different timings depending on people. 

Cryptocurrency token can be used for these purposes 
1) Staking(Short Term) - Natum follows the Proof-Of-Stake concept where users stake their coins(lock in for a certain period of time) and would be rewarded with a ROI. Currently staking 1 NTM token for one day brings about 60% returns. It benefits both parties as this supports blockchain development. This is not investment advice and profitability is minimal due to the fact that 90% of the coins in crypto follow this method of staking. There is no risk-free investment so this is only meant for people who are passionate about Cryptocurrency.

2) Transactions - Natum is built on the ethereum blockchain and transactions are carried out in a span of 12 seconds, faster than any blockchain or crypto technologies. Transactions being carried out at such a great speed reflects the power of the blockchain and its capabilities 

3) NFT marketplace - Whilst this has not been implemented, we are looking forward to implementing a NFT marketplace where users would be able to trade NTM tokens for NFTs.

4) Decentralized Blockchain - Our decentralized blockchain is capable of de-fi tokens where developers would be able to implement smart contracts and applications. This allows anyone to implement a fully function application with our blockchain. 

_For more examples, please refer to our  [Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11T2Lt0RA_CDY_1OzkLeb6IPSdaaLb07k3lWR6N0Vs2A/edit)_






<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Issues

1. Unable to implement token within the pomodoro app as we are unsure of how to distribute our tokens currently.
2. Have not carried out our Initial Coin Offering(ICO) to determine the price of each NTM token due to price fluctuations of the Ethereum Coin and currently waiting for a lower gas fee to make the coin publicly tradable on PancakeSwap and other liquidity pools 



<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
